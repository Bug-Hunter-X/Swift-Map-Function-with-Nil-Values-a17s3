This repository contains a simple example of a common error in Swift's map function. The error occurs when the closure provided to the map function does not return a value, resulting in nil values in the resulting array. This can be a difficult error to track down, as it may not immediately be apparent from the code. The solution demonstrates how to handle this situation by ensuring that the closure always returns a value.
